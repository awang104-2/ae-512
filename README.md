This code simulates steady quasi-one-dimensional adiabatic flow through a converging-diverging nozzle,
assuming supercritical flow, thermodynamic equilibrium, and non-perfect gas behavior. It calculates
the nozzle flow properties such as velocity, Mach number, and thermodynamic state variables (enthalpy, 
density, pressure, etc.) based on area distribution and reservoir conditions.
